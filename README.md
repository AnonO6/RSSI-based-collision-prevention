Smart Ecosystem for Blind School 

Problem statement: 
Unlike regular schools, schools for specially abled posses a plethora of special challenges like ensuring physical safety of students, psychological well being and efficient teaching methods. These challenges can be solved using modern technologies like IoT, embedded systems and technology assisted teaching. 

Objectives: 
Our objective for this project is to effectively utilize the technology, resources and tools taught to us in the course of DPIoT. 
Smart Ecosystem for Blind School aims at achieving the following objectives: 
1. Collision prevention by intercommunication between smart glasses worn by each student using short range BLE mesh. 
2. Position tracking of students using waypoints to monitor students and detect any accidents or missing students. 
3. Navigation assistance by intercommunication between student nodes. 
4. Assisting analysis of collected student data via MQTT broker on Thingspeak IoT platform.

This project can be used to understand more about:
1. Simultaneous BLE and Wifi unitization throught ESP32 wroom.
2. RSSI based distance prediction
3. A way to have half duplex node to node communication using BLE, which is not possible in conventional method where one acts as client and other as server.
